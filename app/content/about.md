About the developer
------------------------------------

My name is Alexander Björkenhall and I currently study PHP, MVC and databases at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola. I have been programming since I was 15, started with C# and are now mostly focusing on web development. 

Besides coding and playing 7 days to die, I enjoy working out and swim and I'm also a huge skiing fan.
